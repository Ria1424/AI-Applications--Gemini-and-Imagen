<p><b>Generative AI on Vertex AI </b> (also known as genAI or gen AI): gives you access to Google's large generative AI models so you can test, tune, and deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications. 
<br> I learnt to tmplement the following:
</p>
Connect to Vertex AI (Google Cloud AI platform):-
<br> 
<ul type="bullet">
<li>Learn how to establish a connection to Google's AI services using the Vertex AI SDK.</li>
<li>Load a pre-trained generative AI model -Gemini: Discover how to use a powerful, pre-trained AI model without building one from scratch.</li>
<li>Send image + text questions to the AI model: Understand how to provide input for the AI to process. </li>
<lil>Extract text-based answers from the AI: Learn to handle and interpret the text responses generated by the AI model </lil>
<li>Understand the basics of building AI applications: Gain insights into the core concepts of integrating AI into software projects</li>
</ul>
